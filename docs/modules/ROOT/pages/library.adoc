:tabula-recta: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_recta

The *Vigenere.xsl* library provides two functions:

* `+vigenere:decrypt(code, cypher_text)+` decrypts the `+cypher_text+` using the key `+code+` provided.
* `+vigenere:encrypt(code, plain_text)+` encrypts the `+plain_text+` using the key `+code+` provided.

The namespace URI for these functions is `+urn:x-vigenere:function+`.
You need to declare this namespace in any XSLT stylesheets that use this library.

The library makes use of a {tabula-recta}[Tabula recta].
I could have used modular arithmetic to perform the encryption and decryption, but I found this method easier to visualise.

The `+plain_text+` and the `+cypher_text+` must _only_ contain lower case alphabetical characters with no accents; i.e.Â no numbers, spaces or punctuation.
This is not enforced by the library at the moment.
If this condition is not met, the library will generate incorrect results.
