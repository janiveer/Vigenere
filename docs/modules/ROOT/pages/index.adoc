== Introduction

This is an XSLT library which enables you to encrypt plain text or decrypt cypher text using the {vigenere-cypher}[Vigenère cypher].
It’s almost completely useless for security purposes.
However this cypher turns up relatively frequently in the books I’ve been reading lately, so I wrote this library for fun and convenience.

The name Vigenère properly includes a grave accent.
I’ve omitted the accent in file names, namespaces, namespace prefixes and repository names, to avoid possible problems with accented characters.
I know, it shouldn’t be a problem in this day and age, but still…

== Prerequisites

An XSLT processor compatible with {xslt}[XSLT 1.0 or 1.1] and {exslt}[eXSLT].
It works with {xsltproc}[XSLTProc].
