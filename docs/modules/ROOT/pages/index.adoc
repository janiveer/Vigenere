Vigenère cypher library for XSLT

== Introduction

This is an XSLT library which enables you to encrypt plain text or decrypt cypher text using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher[Vigenère cypher].
It’s almost completely useless for security purposes.
However this cypher turns up relatively frequently in the books I’ve been reading lately, so I wrote this library for fun and convenience.

The name Vigenère properly includes a grave accent.
I’ve omitted the accent in file names, namespaces, namespace prefixes and repository names, to avoid possible problems with accented characters.
I know, it shouldn’t be a problem in this day and age, but still…

== Prerequisites

An XSLT processor compatible with http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt[XSLT 1.0 or 1.1] and http://exslt.org/[eXSLT].
It works with http://xmlsoft.org/libxslt/[XSLTProc].
